Hi there, ðŸ‘‹! My name is Ellian Carlos. I'm a brazillian full stack developer, math and information systems student.

I'm currently working at [Tokenlab](https://www.tokenlab.com.br/pt/) as a Full Stack Developer, studying Information Systems at the [ICMC](https://www.icmc.usp.br/), an institue of the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](usp.br). I'm also in a undergraduating program to study Analytical Number Theory, using the book [A Primer of Analytical Number Theory](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/primer-of-analytic-number-theory/65F3F8B1F36996F60092ED7F655F0CB3).

I love languages, both the humans and the computer ones. Right now, I'm working with Typescript, Javascript and Python. I'm learning Julia, Typescript and Python. I want to learn Rust and Kotlin someday. I also know some C/C++. About the human languages, I'm fluent in Portuguese and I can speak English. I'm learning Spanish and Japanese and I want to learn Mandarim and German someday.

Besides the languages I'm working with I also use Docker, AWS and SQL in my everyday work.

## Hobbies and Interests

I love to watch football, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Ronaldinho_Ga%C3%BAcho_em_junho_de_2019.jpg/1200px-Ronaldinho_Ga%C3%BAcho_em_junho_de_2019.jpg" target="_blank">the good one</a>,  and to play competitive online games, but I do suck at it. I also love to read about science and math, mainly things about time or history.
